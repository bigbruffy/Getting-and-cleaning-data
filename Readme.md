Explanation on how the script works
--------------


- Open the file *run_analysis.R* to see how the script is structured
- Change the working environment. It should include the data and the R script
- Launch the script by using the command *source(run_analysis)*. The different steps are explained in comment in the script file. 
- The script generates (with the write.table function) a text file called *tydi.txt*. The separator used to create the *txt file* is the tabulation.

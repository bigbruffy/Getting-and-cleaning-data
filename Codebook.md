Course Project: **Getting and Cleaning Data**
==============

Codebook decribing the variables
--------------

- Create the training set from the files *x_train.txt* and *y_train.txt*
- Create the test set from the files *x_set.txt* and *y_set.txt*
- Create a main dataset from those two sets
- Add a variable called features which includes all the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
- Include the name of the activity (from the file *activity_labels.txt*) in the main dataset
- Create the tidy data set which includes the mean of each measurement for each activity
- The resulting dataset is written in a file called *tidy.txt*
